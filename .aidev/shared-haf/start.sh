# the version. Compose bind-mounts <root>/<commit>/haf_db_store directly at
# /home/hived/datadir/haf_db_store — the path the image's postgresql.conf and

# adds the clone setting and hands over to the HAF entrypoint, which starts
# PostgreSQL and then runs serve.sh.

# Environment: HAF_FIXTURE_COMMIT, HAF_SHARED_ROOT (as seed.sh; read by serve.sh).
